The objective of the project is to predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours by using simple linear regression method.Also to predict the score if the student studies for 9.25hrs/day.

Steps involved in this Project
 1)IMPORTING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES
 2)LOADING AND READING THE DATASET
 3)FEATURE EXPLORATION
 4)VISUALIZING THE DATA
 5)DATA PREPARATION
 6)CALCULATING THE ACCURACY OF THE MODEL ON TRAIN AND TEST DATA
 7)SCORING
 8)CHECKING THE TASK
 9)MODEL EVALUATION
10)CONCLUSION




CONCLUSION BASED ON THE PROJECT
1.The standard hours spend by a student to study in a day is 5 hours and the average score obtained by the student in the test is 51 marks.
2.The linear regression coefficient is 9.91 and linear regression intercept is 2.018.
3.The model equation built to predict the Scores of the students is SCORES = 2.0184672 + 9.9158693 * (HOURS).
4.The obtained p-value or test score is 0.94549 which indicates that higher the value,easier the test was.
5.Here,the obtained R-Square Value is 0.95 which clearly indicates that 95% of the variance of the dependent variable(Student Scores) is explained by the variance of the independent variable (Study Hours).
6.If a student studies for 9.25 hours/day,then the predicted score equals to 93.69.
